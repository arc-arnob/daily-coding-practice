# Daily Coding Practice!
### Branch Naming Convention: `<concept>-description`
### How to push your code: 
  1. use `touch concept_name-$(date +"%d-%m-%Y-%X").extension` / `mkdir concept_name-$(date +"%d-%m-%Y-%X")`
  2. `cd` to above directory if need
  3. `touch` your source code here if moved to new directory

## Points to remember:
1. If Concept Directory already exists, use that directory with above naming convention
2. If your souce code needs more that one files/folder, you can `mkdir concept_name-$(date +"%d-%m-%Y-%X")` and work within that.
