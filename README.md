# Daily Coding Practice!
### Branch Naming Convention: `<concept>-description`
### How to push your code: 
  1. If concept directory doesn't exist please make one using `mkdir <concept_name>` else use the existing directory
  2. `CD` to appropriate directory and make your own file using `touch concept_name-$(date +"%d-%m-%Y-%X").extension`
  3. If your practice is a multi file project, make subdirectories using `mkdir <concept_name>-$(date +"%d-%m-%Y-%X")` and `CD` to that directory and write your wonderful code.
  4. Raise PR and assign a reviewer.

## Points to remember:
1. If Concept Directory already exists, use that directory with above naming convention
2. If your souce code needs more that one files/folder, you can `mkdir concept_name-$(date +"%d-%m-%Y-%X")` and work within that.
3. This Repo is open to all and to anything that one wants to practice.
